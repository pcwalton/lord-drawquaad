# Lord Drawquaad

Lord Drawquaad is a minimalist Rust library to draw full-screen textured quads in OpenGL 3.3 and
up. It was born out of annoyance from writing the same code over and over.

You should not use this library if you are particularly concerned about
performance, since it does not do any batching.

## Usage

See `examples/example.rs` for a program that uses the Piston image library to display an image in a
window.
